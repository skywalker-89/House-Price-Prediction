# House Price Prediction

This project focuses on predicting housing prices using a machine learning model, with the aim to provide accurate price estimates based on various features of each house or area.

## Project Overview

This project uses a dataset containing housing information, where each entry represents a different house or region with multiple features (e.g., average number of rooms, population, income level, etc.). The primary goal is to predict the median house price based on these features.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **California Housing Dataset** (or a similar housing dataset), which includes:
- **Features**: Various attributes such as number of rooms, population, income level, etc.
- **Target Variable**: Median house price in thousands of dollars.

## Model Used

The model used in this project is `XGBRegressor`, from the **XGBoost** library, which is known for its high performance and efficiency in regression tasks.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries:
  - `scikit-learn` for model training and testing
  - `xgboost` for implementing the XGBRegressor model
  - `matplotlib` for plotting results

Install the dependencies using:
pip install scikit-learn xgboost matplotlib

## Results

The model's performance is visualized in a scatter plot, where the **Actual Prices** are plotted against the **Predicted Prices**. The points are clustered around a diagonal line, indicating that the model’s predictions align closely with the actual prices.

## Evaluation Metrics

To evaluate model performance, common regression metrics such as **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**, **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**, and **R-squared** can be used. These metrics provide insights into the accuracy of the predictions and the model’s fit to the data.

## Usage

To train and test the model:

1. Load the dataset.
2. Split the data into training and testing sets.
3. Train the `XGBRegressor` model on the training set.
4. Make predictions on the test set.
5. Plot the actual vs. predicted prices to visualize performance.

## Future Work

- Explore additional features to improve prediction accuracy.
- Experiment with other regression models and compare performance.
- Fine-tune the hyperparameters of `XGBRegressor` for potentially better results.
